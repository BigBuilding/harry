# Next steps

## Missing features

+ Matric class (encapsulates storage details)
+ Selection of ranges (rectangular matrices)
+ On-the-fly computation (e.g. for patched libsvm or shogun)

## Missing outputs

+ matlab full and triangle matrix format
+ others: numpy? shogun? weka?

## Missing measures

+ Spectrum kernel
+ Locality improved kernel
+ OSA similarity something
+ Similarity coefficients

## Special hacks

+ Kernel-to-distance: simple map to Euclidean distance
+ Distance-to-Kernel: maps by B. Haasdonk
