# TODO

## New features

+ Splitting of large martices, i.e. -s 9:3 (split into 9 and compute 3)
+ Memory saving by freeing strings out of ranges
+ On-the-fly computation (e.g. for patched libsvm or shogun)

## Input and Output

+ Support for compression of stdout
+ Support for compression of input formats?
+ Matlab support
